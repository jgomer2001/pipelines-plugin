# OpenSearch Cedarling demo plugin

This is a demo plugin aimed at integrating token-based access control into [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org). Specifically it is focused on filtering search results obtained in response to search queries sent to any of the endpoints listed [here](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/search-apis/search/). Filtering takes place based on the Cedarling policy provided in the plugin settings.
